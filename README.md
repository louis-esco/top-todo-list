# top-todo-list
Link: https://louis-esco.github.io/top-todo-list/
Improvements: 
- Storage.js and todo-controller.js could be merged together to avoid redundancy (implemented todo-controller before dealing with localStorage)
- CSS classes and declarations could be improved for readability
- Scope variables from display.js into their respective functions
- Save done todos (to save time I've deleted them when marking them done)
